# Quad_Quantiser
The original inspiration for this project came from the Dual Quantizer by Hagiwo (https://note.com/solder_state/n/nb8b9a2f212a2), in particular the use of an RP2040 microcontroller and the general style of the OLED display / rotary encoder user interface. There the resemblance pretty much ends.

This project uses a WaveShare RP2040 Zero board as the processor, a MAX5715 12-bit 4-channel SPI DAC
